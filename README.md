# Spline-Based Dense Medial Descriptors for Image Compression: Supplementary Material

This material shows the comparison of JPEG results with SDMD results for several image types. For each image, we show the SSIM quality score and compression ratio (CR) of the JPEG (green asterisks) and SDMD (red filled dots) under several different quality settings. We also show the reconstruction of two methods under one specific quality setting.
