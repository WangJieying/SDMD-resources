# Scientific Visualization Data

**These are computer rendered images of scientific data visualized by several methods such as color mapping, isosurfaces, and volume rendering. The underlying data types span a wide range, covering volumetric scalar fields, vector fields from flow and flame simulations, and distance fields used in modeling. Such images are characterized by a rich color palette, color blending, both smooth gradients and sharp transitions, and complex shapes having various levels of detail.**
